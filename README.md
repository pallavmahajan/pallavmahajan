## 👨‍💻 About Me

I bridge **engineering, analytics, and business strategy**—shaping insights into real-world outcomes. With an MBA in Marketing and a Data Analytics Master’s in progress at San Jose State University, I specialize in:

- **Building intelligent data pipelines and AI solutions**
- **Designing scalable, cloud-native systems**
- **Applying Generative AI to business and social use cases**

My work spans GenAI, big data pipelines, recommender systems, and healthcare AI—always focused on outcomes, not just models.

> I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities or Summer 2025 internships in **Data Analytics**, **ML/AI**, or **GenAI product roles**.
